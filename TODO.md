# Short-Term Goals:

1. Installation instruction.
2. New screenshots for Github.
3. Check whether sort_require.cr is really working.
4. Resource packing for widgets.
5. Implement states: game, game_debug, loading, menu, title.
6. Implement particle system.
7. Refactor old widgets.
8. Create new widgets: slider, progress_bar, window, something to display data.
9. Create a very simple game demo, with one level and one boss.
10. Implement list, stack and queue, so I don't have to use array for everything.
11. Reorganize project structure to conform to Crystal standards.
12. Unit tests for things which can be tested.

# Long-term Goals:

1. Get rid of CrSFML and create something similar using GLFW and couple of other libraries.
2. Port Box2D to Crystal.
3. Reorganize game to some kind of space sandbox.
